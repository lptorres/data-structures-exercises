# data-structures-exercises
My solutions in Python to select exercises from Prof. Quiwa's Data Structures book.

## Why?

I took the data structures class in my sophomore year (2010) of CS, when the department was largely still conducting it in C or Java. I've been working with Python for over 4 years at this point and decided to reread the book and do the exercises in Python because:
- Practice! It never hurts.
- I want to gauge how well I still understand these fundamentals, and reinforce when I don't.
